This is the game i'm working on.  

It's a 3D 3rd person platformer. 
You have ability to stop time which 
is upgraded during the gameplay. I don't know
how many levels i'll make but i know that the game will have a story.  

I hope i will publish it somewhere when i finish it. Probably in Steam.  

Currently i'm working on gameplay so it doesn't look good right now. Try out the build of the game and tell me what do you think about the idea. :)
